# Foonances

Finances about anything.

You have to rename config/config.sample.php to config/config.php and config/database.sample.php to config/database.php

### Database

1. Use the following commands to create the database

```
create database foonances default character set utf8 default collate utf8_general_ci;
grant all privileges on foonances.* to 'foonances'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
```

2. Run .sql scripts in install folder.
